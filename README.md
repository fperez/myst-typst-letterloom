# MyST letter template

This is a template for writing letters in [myst](https://mystmd.org/), wrapping the [typst letterloom template](https://typst.app/universe/package/letterloom).

You can see an example PDF [here](https://github.com/stefanv/myst-typst-letterloom/blob/example/letter.pdf).

To use the template, clone this repository, then customize the example in [./example](./example).
Once the template is published, you'll be able to use it independently of this repository.

## For theme developers

The `letterloom` directory was populated from https://github.com/nandac/letterloom/tree/main/src
